This project contains automated tests written using Playwright. To get started, clone the repository, navigate into the project folder, and install dependencies using yarn install or npm install. Once installed, run npx playwright test to execute all test cases. You can also run tests in headed mode with npx playwright test --headed or open the latest HTML report using npx playwright show-report. Project settings, including browser type, base URL, and timeouts, can be configured in playwright.config.ts, and temporary files such as node_modules and reports are excluded via .gitignore.
